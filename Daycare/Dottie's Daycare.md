### General Thoughts & Tour Notes
- staff retention is high
- family operated for 40 years
- staff to children ratio is about 5 kids to 1 staff member at infancy. The children to staff ratio increases over time.
- Would be interested in having Bella attend when she is 1 year old, but would prefer F.M Day.
### Concerns
- no curriculum and evidence based research used
- people are able to walk in with minimal security
### Cost
- Infant/Toddler: $1,030 / month
- 2 1/2 years old and up: $825 / month
### To Do's
- [x] get added to waitlist ðŸ“… 2024-06-18 âœ… 2024-06-25
